In Sakura, a restaurant I used to work at, one can find a very interesting style of Japanese cuisine called Teppanyaki. There are U-shaped tables for 10 guests who sit along 3 of the table's sides facing an iron griddle in the middle of the table.

When guests come in, they are welcomed by a hostess, who asks how many they are, accompanies them to a free table, which she sets as "open", and turns on the electric griddle. If the table is not full, she sets a timer for 20 minutes. A server comes soon after and takes an order for drinks. He then serves the drinks, and takes an order for food which he writes down on a standardised paper with a table plan as seen from above.

The server then takes the order to the kitchen, where it is assigned to a cook who prepares all ingredients that are needed and puts them on a cart. In the meantime, the server prepares a bowl of soup and a salad for each guest, and brings them to the table. Hostesses may sit new guests at the table in the meantime.

After 20 minutes have passed, the server and hostesses now see the table as "closed" and no additional guests can be added. The cook then comes wit a cart with needed ingredients. prepares all meals on the griddle in front of the guests, and serves them into guests' plates. When the guests are done with their food a grill cleaner comes and cleans the griddle with lemon juice. He must come only after guests are done eating and be quick, especially when the restaurant is busy.

This application will help employees communicate the whole process to be more precise and efficient.
